# SUMMARY OF PROJECT

Trivia King is a trivia web application that features a huge database of questions, a distinctive lifeline system, a secure account system, and the ability to track a user's progress in the game. The database of questions comes from an external API that we hooked up to the application. The current lifeline system has two options for the user to choose from. The account system was implemented by using hashing algorithms to store passwords safely and by giving users the option to create an account with a third-party service like Google OAuth.

This app is mainly being done with ReactJS and Tailwind CSS in the frontend and a NodeJS/MySQL backend.
